Aurubis AG (formerly Norddeutsche Affinerie AG) is the largest copper producer in Europe (the second largest in the world) and the largest copper recycler worldwide. In this project, our team aimed to improve the accuracy of predicted yield in Aurubis Buffalo. We created Tableau dashboard to explore the material and operation data and used Python to build different models and machine learning interface.

In this project I gained experience with data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive analysis using Tableau and Python. Besides, My team member and I completed two interactive products that are showed below.

## Algorithms Used
Random Forest

XGBoost

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression

## Final Result

Our team use MSE to evaluate the models. It turns out that there's no big difference between the performance of these 4 models. However, lasso and ridge regression are more explainable compared to random forest and XGBoost. Ridge regression improved about 45.7% based on the original model, and the mean square error decreased to less than 3%. In addition to building these regression models, Our team also build a tableau dashboard to explore the data and a machine learning interface for the clients to select models they like and see the prediction made by them. We ranked first in this business analytics project probabaly because of these two interactive products.
